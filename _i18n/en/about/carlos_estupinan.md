The ESTUPINAN ART corporation has the pleasure of representing the work of the French Colombo artist Carlos Estupinan to the artistic community and the general public . Constantly transhumance, this artist has made long stays both in the East and in the West . He has been formed and nurtured from diverse geographical and cultural spaces . Being Colombian means he carries within the legacy of Latin American culture . The East and China in particular have provided him with all the ancestral wisdom of his ancient cosmogony during his years of artistic training . Knowledge and practice in the elusive realm of intuition . Also in Europe he acquires the knowledge of "method" and "reason" . The "tour" is played if we tie it to American magic . Dreamer and stalker cast in solid invoice, this artist ventures into the divination of the possible .



His abstract work in painting is of an intense purity and elaborate workmanship . He investigates and feeds on a deep and total universe where the raw material is the fundamental questions of existence . A good answer always leads to a new question . His imaginary, intangible and ephemeral universe is actually a map to navigate in the apparent materiality of the universe that we face on a daily basis . And if we are dream machines born in a dark -bright world, vibrations out of nowhere, we only manage to simulate the horizon of an environment . This map allows us to return the question to the environment about the existence of being . More than a question, it is a grateful cry, deep and harsh at times . Map and territory come closer and propose a welding through the artistic act . Ultimately, as the artist himself often says, it is a divination of what is possible . We leave the billing, technique, and artistic style part to your imagination so that you can complete the work with your answers to this open question . As a consequence of all this, we have decided to represent the work of this artist, so that you can appreciate it and, if possible, integrate it into his imaginary .
